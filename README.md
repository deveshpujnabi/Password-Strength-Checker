# Password Strength Evaluator

This Python script evaluates the strength of a given password. The script checks various criteria such as length, presence of digits, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters to classify the password strength as "weak," "medium," or "strong."

## Features

- **Password Strength Evaluation**: The script evaluates the strength of a password based on several factors, including length, use of digits, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** must be installed on your system.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-strength-evaluator.git
   cd password-strength-evaluator
   ```

2. **Run the Program:**

   ```bash
   python password_strength.py
   ```

3. **Input the Password:**

   - The program will prompt you to enter a password.

Password strength: strong
```
